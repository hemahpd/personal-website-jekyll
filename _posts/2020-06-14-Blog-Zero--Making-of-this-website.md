<p>Creating this website was a journey of trial and error, and experiential guessing. There are so many ways to go about creating a website now and its very easy to get lost in trying to pick the BEST option. I wanted to pick a platform or technology that I could get up and running relatively quickly, while retaining control of how to setup the backend and taking the opportunity to learn relevant industry skills.</p>

<p>My previous website was setup with a Django backend but I didn't host it as I couldn't get the best out of it. You can find the code for that <a href="https://github.com/hemahpd/personal-website-django">here</a>.</p>

<p>This website is made with Jekyll, a static website generator. At some point in the future I wanted to move my content to a dynamic website. This is <del>probably</del> definitely overkill for a simple personal website, however it was a good opportunity to learn Jekyll in creating a personal website along with blog.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
